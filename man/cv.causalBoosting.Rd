\title{Fit a causal boosting model with cross validation}
\usage{
cv.causalBoosting(x, tx, y, num.trees = 500, maxleaves = 4, eps = 0.01,
  splitSpread = 0.1, type.measure = c("effect", "response"), nfolds = 5,
  foldid = NULL, propensity = FALSE, stratum = NULL, isConstVar = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{matrix of covariates}

\item{tx}{vector of treatment indicators (0 or 1)}

\item{y}{vector of response values}

\item{num.trees}{number of shallow causal trees to build}

\item{maxleaves}{maximum number of leaves per causal tree}

\item{eps}{learning rate}

\item{splitSpread}{how far apart should the candidate splits be for the
causal trees? (e.g. \code{splitSpread = 0.1}) means we consider 10 quantile
cutpoints as candidates for making split}

\item{type.measure}{loss to use for cross validation:
'response' returns mean-square error for predicting response in each arm.
'effect' returns MSE for treatment effect using honest over-fit estimation.}

\item{nfolds}{number of cross validation folds}

\item{foldid}{vector of fold membership}

\item{propensity}{logical: should propensity score stratification be used?}

\item{stratum}{optional vector giving propensity score stratum for each
observation (only used if \code{propensity = TRUE})}

\item{isConstVar}{logical: for the causal tree splitting criterion
(T-statistc), should it be assumed that the noise variance is the same in
treatment and control arms?}
}
\value{

 class \code{causalBoosting} with these additional attributes:
 \itemize{
   \item num.trees.min: number of trees with lowest CV error
   \item cvm: vector of mean CV error for each number of trees
   \item cvsd: vector of standard errors for mean CV errors
