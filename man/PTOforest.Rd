\title{Fit a pollinated transformed outcome (PTO) forest model}
\usage{
PTOforest(x, tx, y, pscore = rep(0.5, nrow(x)), num.trees = 500,
  mtry = ncol(x), min.node.size = max(25, nrow(x)/40), postprocess = TRUE,
  verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{matrix of covariates}

\item{tx}{vector of treatment indicators (0 or 1)}

\item{y}{vector of response values}

\item{pscore}{vector of propensity scores}

\item{num.trees}{number of trees for transformed outcome forest}

\item{mtry}{number of variables to possibly split at in each node}

\item{min.node.size}{minimum node size for transformed outcome forest}

\item{postprocess}{logical: should optional post-processing random forest be
fit at end?}

\item{verbose}{logical: should progress be printed to console?}
}
\value{
an object of class \code{PTOforest} with attributes:
 \itemize{
   \item x: matrix of covariates supplied by function call
   \item pscore: vector of propensity score supplied by function call
   \item postprocess: logical supplied by function call
   \item TOfit: fitted random forest on transformed outcomes
